# 02 - Company Familiarisation

This document is established in order to familiarise new joining Captain and **[%company]** staff. At the discretion of the captain this can also be used for the familiarisation of the Officers and head of Department (Chief Engineer, Chef and Chief Stewardess).

---

## General policy of the company

As explained in the Yacht management System, **[%company]**, the management company request a complete respect of the international laws and conventions like SOLAS, MARPOL, STCW and MLC.

Doing so a safe working environment is secured to the crew members: the familiarisation, instructions, training and drills are the corner stones of the daily activities on board. The crew has to receive the accurate personal protective gears and uniforms as well as to be informed of their duties and responsibilities (Job description) as well as the general rules established on board: Standing Orders.

The risk assessment conducted by C/O and the DPA, then the issuance of the permits to work are crucial for a safe operation of the ship. Routines operational procedures as well as emergency procedures must be reviewed with care and improved. This is a state of mind that Yachting Concept wants to develop in every part of the team ashore or at sea. The review and audit are crucial for the constant improvement of the safety, security and respect of the maritime environment and property.

The safe manning and the notion of safe return to port must be kept in mind by all. The correct adaptation of the safe manning and the proper certification and training of the crew is indispensable to a safe navigation.

The work of the shore base team and the usage of the reg4yachts will insure an appropriate knowledge of the regulation and evolutions. The good relation with the classification society is also a strong point. Preparing the annual surveys, the Company and Captain have to get all relevant information from the class surveyor. Consultancy, audits, survey,... must be considered to update the ship, shore-based team and the seafarers.

Internal audit, review and regular visits of the DPA will also contribute to verify the compliance with the ISM and ISPS code but also to the SMS and the company policy.

**[%company]** policies includes but is not limited to the following documents and plans:

- Ship Management system
- Drug & Alcohol Policy
- Standing orders
- Job description
- Familiarisation
- Drill schedule
- Risk assessment & Permit to work
- Garbage management plan
- Ship Energy Efficiency Plan
- SOPEP
- Cyber Security Plan

## Purchase process

When contractors are needed or some purchases must be done, the Captain and crew shall ask quotations, generally at least 2 are required. The shipboard team can ask the assistance of the Technical manager and/or DPA and/or assistant management.

This process is then based on the usage of the DeepBlue© software – accounting section:

1. The captain or head of department will upload the quote as “pending quote”.
2. Once the invoice received (deposit, pro forma invoice, front payment...), the invoice is upload and registered as “pending invoice”.
3. Then the Captain has to approve “approved by Captain”.
4. Once done, the DPA and/or technical manager will approve “approved by management”;
5. The accounting department will then require the payment to the bank and upload the relevant document..
6. The owner representative will give the final authorisation to the bank when needed (depending on the Management contract).

This system has been established in the idea that the captain, management and owner representative are all involved in the payment process and so aware of the situation (technical and financial).

In case of emergency, the captain has the possibility to address his request directly to the DPA and/or Technical Manager by email. Then the company will internally organise a quick payment. This can be the case of technical failure, urgent needs of safety equipment, appointment of surveyor, special needs for a charter... but must remain exceptional.

## Maintenance & follow up of the works

The purchase/payment process as describe here above shall insure a correct selection of the contractors (by the approval at different stage on board and ashore), the correct financial and technical follow up of the work and purchase needed on board.

In other terms, the captain knows what is required by the crew and valid the expanse, the DPA and technical manager are aware of the current situation on board as well as the owner representative when required. Finally, the accounting is up to date.

All invoices are uploaded in the accounting section but should also be available in the Maintenance section. Each work should be added with support documents (drawings, service report, invoice, notes from contractor and crew – head of department and/or Captain).

The principle is to work with a minimum of contractors for several reason:

- Correct knowledge of the ship;
- Regular invoicing and price reduction;
- Limiting the number of “visitors” on board.

The efficiency of the cooperation with the technicians and providers, pricing, reactivity should be estimated at least once a year during the captain review and then discuss during the director review.

The Captain and crew have to give their feedback and then this must be discussed with DPA, CEO and technical manager. Then a list of “preferred contractors” should be established within the company.

## Risk assessment

As mentioned in the general policy and Ship Management System, risk assessments are a real concern and must be done in an efficient way. A risk assessment form is in used and must be established for the activities detected as “dangerous”. Some activities can be accepted only under certain circumstances and so need a permit to work approved by Captain or Chief Officer or Safety officer (if any).

At least once a year the risk assessment form must be reviewed. The safety committee meetings are also a privileged moment to get feedback from the crew and discuss emergency and operational procedure and so the inherent risk assessment. Specific risks or unassessed situations should be identified thanks to the input of the crew during these meetings. The review of the management company and visits of the DPA and/or technical management should be also considered in the general understanding of the risk assessment policy.

===

## Regulations

All departments on board and ashore are concerned by the evolution of the regulation. Therefore, everyone is requested to pay a great care to the issuance of new law, conventions, notices in his specific party. Despite of a general awareness, the Resident Agent is in charge to transfer all new regulation and communication from the Flag authorities. The subscription to Reg4yachts will provide precious information to the shipboard team and finally the DPA and Technical manager shall inform the Captain and crew for every specific change in the regulation concerning the ship.

## Audit, review, reporting: revision of the SMS

Except the first year (specific process detailed in the audit & review procedure), there is mandatory reviews and audits. Special survey could also take place. It has been developed in the idea of a permanent revision of the SMS. The aim is to improve the quality of the operations in a safe working environment. The revisions are needed but need to be handle carefully. Therefore, the following process shall be followed has explained in the SMS Manual.

The principle will remain the same: proposal from the captain to the DPA after an event or during required review or after an internal audit or during a special report or during the monthly report ISM Findings. The captain’s proposal can of course come from the crew – safety committee should be orientated to do so. The approval of the DPA is required prior to the implementation on board.

The reviewed document must be sent by the DPA and implemented on the on-board documentation. The modification must be duly registered in the record of revision. Record shared by the ship and the company. It is extremely important to strictly follow this process and so to be sure that the ship and the company have the same updated documentation.

> The **[%company]** policy is based on the respect of the applicable regulation, the professionalism of everyone in the chain (as every link is important), the respect of the procedures and to always optimise the quality of the communication between all persons involved. This insure a safe navigation, efficient operations and so satisfied guests and happy crew.
